Currently this repository contains code to produce vineyards that aid in time series analysis of the persistent homology of data. Much of the code deals specifically with the fmri use case but can easily be generalized to other use cases.

# Motivation 
One would like to identify if a persistent homological feature is stable over time. This repository contains rudimentary tools to identify and study such features.
